### Exploratory Data Analysis
This part mainly has following purposes:

#### 1. Preprocess the data
   --Convert the data into a format we can use, since some columns are in JSON format, containing one or more dictionaries inside.
   
   --Create new columns based on current information 
   
#### 2. Summary statistics
   --mean, median, sd 
   
   --mean target value for each category: if this category has a high mean value with only few observations, this is due to random and we need to combine this category with other category, otherwise, this category is very important
   
#### 3. Plots 
   --Investigate the features
   
   --Identify outliers
   
   --If the numerical data is highly skewed, make transformations
   
   --Compare the distribution between train and test data: if they are very different, avoid using this variable
  
#### 4. Data Issues and Data Cleaning
   --outliers
   
   --noise
  
   --missing value
   
   --collinearity
